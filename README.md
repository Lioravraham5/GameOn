# Game On Application
Welcome to Game On, an Android application designed to help users find and order sports fields in Israel for their practice sessions. Below is an overview of the application along with important details for developers and users.
This is my final project for Android Application Development course, in Afeka - the academic college of Engineering in Tel Aviv.

# Overview
Game On is a mobile application built for Android devices that facilitates the process of finding, viewing, and ordering sports fields in Israel. Users can register, view available fields on a map, and place orders for specific dates and times.

# Features:
1. **User Registration**: Users can register by entering a username, full name, and password. Registered users gain access to the ordering functionality.
2. **Map Integration**: Utilizes Google Maps to display all available fields and their locations.
3. **Real-Time Database**: Utilizes Firebase's real-time database to store:
   - Registered user details including associated orders
   - Field details, including addresses and associated orders.
